      <h2>
        Understand <strong>Slow Scan Television (SSTV)</strong> and <br />
        How to <strong>Decode SSTV Images</strong>
      </h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Slow Scan Television</strong>, abbreviated as
        <strong>SSTV</strong>, is a technique used to transmit static images
        over narrowband radio frequencies. It is widely used by
        <strong>amateur radio operators</strong> and space agencies due to its
        efficiency in sending visual data using minimal bandwidth. Unlike
        traditional video transmission, which requires high data rates, SSTV
        sends images line by line as modulated audio tones, making it ideal for
        long-distance and low-power communications.
      </p>

      <p>
        SSTV was initially developed in the 1950s for military and scientific
        use. Over time, it became a popular tool among radio amateurs,
        especially for communicating during emergencies, engaging in hobby
        activities, and receiving images from space missions, including
        broadcasts from the <strong>International Space Station</strong>. The
        audio signal, once recorded or received live, can be decoded back into a
        visual image using this <strong>SSTV Decoder</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>SSTV Signal Structure</h3>
      <p>
        An SSTV transmission follows a structured format that enables precise
        decoding. It typically includes the following components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Leader tone</strong>: A continuous high-frequency tone,
          usually around 1900 Hz, that prepares the decoder for synchronization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Break signal</strong>: A brief lower-frequency tone, around
          1200 Hz, that indicates the end of the leader tone.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>VIS code</strong>: A set of tones encoding the mode used,
          allowing the decoder to interpret the image structure correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Synchronization pulses</strong>: Regular tones marking the
          beginning of each line or channel within the image.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Image scan lines</strong>: The core of the transmission, where
          each pixel's brightness or color is represented by an audio frequency.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Common SSTV Modes</h3>
      <p>
        SSTV supports various transmission modes, each designed to balance image
        resolution, transmission speed, and audio bandwidth. Some of the most
        widely used modes are listed below:
      </p>
      <table class="encoding-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Mode</th>
            <th>Resolution</th>
            <th>Transmission Time</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Robot36</td>
            <td>320 by 240</td>
            <td>~ 36 seconds</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Scottie1</td>
            <td>320 by 256</td>
            <td>~ 110 seconds</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Martin1</td>
            <td>320 by 256</td>
            <td>~ 114 seconds</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Robot72</td>
            <td>320 by 240</td>
            <td>~ 72 seconds</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Martin2</td>
            <td>320 by 256</td>
            <td>~ 58 seconds</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Scottie2</td>
            <td>320 by 256</td>
            <td>~ 71 seconds</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>ScottieSDX</td>
            <td>640 by 496</td>
            <td>~ 539 seconds</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Decoding Process</h3>
      <p>
        Decoding an SSTV signal involves converting the received audio tones
        into pixel data. The process generally includes the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Identify and extract the VIS header to determine the SSTV mode used
          for encoding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the leader tone and sync pulses to align the decoding process with
          the signal timing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Perform a Fast Fourier Transform, or FFT, on each time window to
          measure the dominant frequency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Translate each frequency value into a luminance or color channel
          intensity for the corresponding pixel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble the pixels line by line to reconstruct the final image on the
          display.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Technical Characteristics</h3>
      <p>
        SSTV signals operate within the audio frequency range, typically between
        1500 and 2300 Hz. Each color or brightness value is transmitted by
        holding a specific frequency for a short duration. In color modes like
        YUV, three separate channels are used: Y for brightness, U and V for
        color difference components.
      </p>
      <p>
        Synchronization tones are critical for reliable decoding. These tones
        ensure that the decoder remains aligned with the image structure
        throughout the transmission. Without correct synchronization, the
        decoded image may appear distorted, offset, or scrambled.
      </p>

      <h3>Use Cases and Practical Applications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Amateur radio image transmission during regular contacts or contests
        </li>
        <li>
          Reception of commemorative or scientific images from the International
          Space Station
        </li>
        <li>
          Hands-on learning tool for signal processing and modulation techniques
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          Remote communication in disaster scenarios where text or image data
          must be exchanged over voice channels
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Modern SSTV Decoding Tools</h3>
      <p>
        SSTV decoding used to rely on desktop applications such as
        <strong>MMSSTV</strong> and <strong>RX-SSTV</strong>, typically
        available for Windows operating systems. Today, advancements in web
        technologies allow users to decode SSTV transmissions directly in their
        browser using <strong>JavaScript</strong> and the
        <strong>Web Audio API</strong>. This provides cross-platform access and
        eliminates the need for software installation, making SSTV more
        accessible to beginners, educators, and hobbyists.
      </p>
      <p>
        This web-based <strong>SSTV Decoder</strong> is inspired by the

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        SSTV remains a unique and engaging method of communication, blending
        audio engineering with image processing. Whether used for hobby
        purposes, scientific outreach, or technical education, SSTV provides a
        hands-on way to explore the fundamentals of analog communication. With
        modern digital tools, decoding SSTV transmissions has become more
        accessible than ever, helping preserve and expand this historic radio
        tradition.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions about SSTV</h2>

      <h3>What is SSTV and how does it work?</h3>
      <p>
        SSTV, or Slow Scan Television, is a method of sending still images over
        audio frequencies. It works by encoding each line of the image as a
        sequence of tones, which can be transmitted via radio and decoded back
        into a picture using software or hardware tools.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I decode SSTV signals directly in my browser?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. With modern web technologies such as the Web Audio API and
        JavaScript, you can decode SSTV audio recordings in real time within
        your browser. This website provides a cross-platform tool for decoding
        common SSTV formats like Robot36, Scottie1, and Martin1.
      </p>

      <h3>What types of files can I use to decode an SSTV image?</h3>
      <p>
        You can upload most common audio file formats, such as WAV, MP3, or OGG.
        Ensure the recording is clear and has minimal background noise for
        accurate decoding.
      </p>

      <h3>What are the most common SSTV modes?</h3>
      <p>
        Popular SSTV modes include Robot36, Scottie1, Martin1 and ScottieSDX.
        Each mode differs in resolution, color format, and transmission time.
        This decoder supports a wide variety of these formats automatically by
        detecting the VIS code.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need a license to transmit SSTV signals?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Transmitting SSTV over radio frequencies generally requires an
        amateur radio license, depending on your countryâ€™s regulations.
        Receiving and decoding SSTV transmissions, however, is legal and
        unrestricted in most regions.
